# EasyWebsiteBuild — Business Analysis

> Written as if Alex Hormozi just inherited this product and is treating it like his next portfolio company. Frameworks drawn from _$100M Offers_, _$100M Leads_, and _Gym Launch Secrets_. No fluff. Actions only.

## 1. The Honest Situation

Let's be brutally honest about where we are before we talk about where we're going.

**What we have:**

- A sophisticated AI-powered website assembly engine (genuinely novel technology)
- 18 modular components with multiple variants each
- A 9-step brand personality capture system that's legitimately more thoughtful than anything on the market
- 7 theme presets, emotional overrides, voice-keyed content generation
- A working demo that produces a single-page site from intake responses
- Zero revenue
- Zero users
- Zero market validation

**What we don't have:**

- Paying customers
- A defined ideal customer avatar
- A pricing model that's been tested
- Any proof that someone will pay money for this
- Multi-page sites, real images, editing, deployment, or accounts

**The core problem:** We have been building a product for months without ever asking someone to give us money for it. This is the #1 mistake that kills technical founders. We are solving a problem we think exists with a solution we think is cool, and we haven't validated either assumption with cash.

**Hormozi's first rule: Revenue is the only validation that matters.** Not compliments. Not "that's cool." Not newsletter signups. Someone handing you money is the only signal that you've built something worth building.

## 2. The Value Equation

Every buying decision runs through one equation:

```
                Dream Outcome  ×  Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Value = ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                Time Delay  ×  Effort & Sacrifice
```

Let's map our product to each variable:

### Dream Outcome

A professional website that represents their brand accurately and brings in customers/clients.

**Score: High.** Every business needs this. The dream outcome is universal and valuable. A good website is a revenue-generating asset, not an expense. If a barbershop's website brings in 5 extra clients a month at $40 each, that's $2,400/year in additional revenue. The website paid for itself many times over.

### Perceived Likelihood of Achievement

Does the customer believe they'll actually get a good website from us?

**Score: Low right now.** We're unknown. We have no case studies, no testimonials (the ones on the homepage are fake), no social proof, no portfolio of real sites we've built. Nobody has a reason to believe this works.

**Fix:** We need 5-10 real sites built for real businesses that we can show. These are our "proof of concept" clients. We do them for free or cheap — not because our product isn't worth money, but because we need the proof more than we need the cash right now.

### Time Delay

How long between "I want a website" and "I have a website"?

**Score: Very strong (potentially).** This is our biggest competitive advantage. Traditional path: hire a designer ($3,000-$15,000, 4-8 weeks). Squarespace DIY: free-ish, but 20-40 hours of the business owner's time over 2-4 weeks. Us: answer questions for 15 minutes, get a site same day.

**The speed advantage only matters if the output quality is good enough.** A fast bad website is worse than a slow good one. So quality is the gating factor.

### Effort & Sacrifice

How much work does the customer have to do?

**Score: Strong.** Answer some questions. That's it. No design decisions, no dragging and dropping, no learning a page builder, no hiring someone and going back and forth on revisions for weeks. This is genuinely low-effort for the customer.

### Value Equation Summary

| Variable             | Current               | Potential         |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Dream Outcome        | High                  | High              |
| Perceived Likelihood | **Low**               | High (with proof) |
| Time Delay           | **Low (fast = good)** | Very low          |
| Effort & Sacrifice   | **Low**               | Very low          |

**Conclusion:** The numerator (dream outcome) is solid. The denominator (time + effort) is our competitive moat — we're genuinely faster and easier than alternatives. The bottleneck is perceived likelihood. Nobody believes us yet. Everything in the next 90 days should be focused on creating proof.

## 3. Who Is the Customer? (Niche Down or Die)

"Everyone who needs a website" is not an answer. That's a death sentence. Hormozi's law: **the riches are in the niches.**

### Why Niching Matters

If you try to sell to everyone:

- Your messaging is generic ("Build any website!")
- You compete with Squarespace, Wix, Framer, WordPress, and every freelancer on Earth
- Your product has to be good at everything (impossible at this stage)
- You can't charge premium prices because there's nothing specific about your value

If you sell to one specific group:

- Your messaging is a laser ("Professional websites for med spas in 15 minutes")
- You only compete with people serving that exact niche
- Your product only has to be excellent for that one use case
- You can charge more because you understand their specific world

### Picking the Niche

Score each potential niche on three criteria:

1. **Pain level** — How badly do they need a website? How much does NOT having a good one cost them?
2. **Purchasing power** — Can they afford to pay $500-$2,000 for a website? Do they already spend money on marketing?
3. **Accessibility** — Can we find and reach these people easily?

| Niche                                           | Pain | Budget | Access | Score  | Notes                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Med spas / aesthetics                           | 9    | 9      | 7      | **25** | High-ticket services, image-obsessed, already spend on marketing  |
| Local service businesses (plumbers, HVAC, etc.) | 7    | 6      | 8      | 21     | Need websites but often cheap; high volume though                 |
| Restaurants / cafes                             | 7    | 5      | 8      | 20     | Every restaurant needs one, low budgets, easy to find             |
| Real estate agents                              | 8    | 8      | 7      | **23** | Must have web presence, big budgets, competitive market           |
| Fitness / personal trainers                     | 8    | 6      | 8      | 22     | Growing market, active on social, need booking                    |
| Photographers / creatives                       | 8    | 5      | 7      | 20     | Need portfolios desperately, but low budgets                      |
| Coaches / consultants                           | 8    | 7      | 7      | 22     | Need credibility sites, will pay for positioning                  |
| Dental practices                                | 8    | 9      | 6      | **23** | High revenue per patient, professional, need trust-building sites |
| Salons / barbershops                            | 7    | 6      | 8      | 21     | High volume, easy to find, need booking                           |
| Wedding vendors                                 | 8    | 7      | 7      | 22     | Seasonal urgency, portfolio-heavy, emotional purchase             |

### Recommendation: Start with ONE of the top 3

**Med spas / aesthetics** or **dental practices** or **real estate agents.**

Why these three:

- They already spend money on marketing (proves budget exists)
- Their website is a direct revenue driver (not just a "nice to have")
- They care deeply about brand image and aesthetics (our differentiator shines)
- They're easy to find (Google Maps, Instagram, industry directories)
- The average customer lifetime value justifies a $500-$2,000 website

**Pick one. Not two. Not three. One.** We can expand later. Right now, we need to be the best in the world for ONE type of customer.

For this analysis, I'll use **med spas** as the example niche. Swap in whichever you choose.

## 4. The Grand Slam Offer

An offer so good people feel stupid saying no. This is the single most important thing in the business.

### What Med Spas Currently Pay

- **Freelance web designer:** $3,000-$8,000 for a custom site, 4-8 weeks timeline
- **Agency:** $8,000-$25,000, 6-12 weeks
- **Squarespace/Wix DIY:** $200-$500/year in subscriptions + 20-40 hours of their own time (which they value at $100-$300/hour as a business owner, so the real cost is $2,000-$12,000 in opportunity cost)
- **Template sites:** $500-$1,500, often look generic

### What They Actually Want

Based on the value equation, med spa owners want:

1. A website that looks as premium as their $500/treatment services
2. Online booking or inquiry capture (turns the website into a revenue tool)
3. To not have to think about design decisions — they're clinicians, not designers
4. To have it done fast — they're busy running a practice
5. Trust signals: before/after photos, testimonials, credentials, certifications

### The Offer Structure

> **"Professional Med Spa Website — Live in 48 Hours — or It's Free"**
>
> What you get:
>
> - Complete multi-page website (Home, Services, About, Before & After, Contact) [when we have multi-page]
> - AI-powered brand personality matching (your site looks like YOUR brand, not a template)
> - Mobile-optimized and fast (built on Next.js, the same framework Netflix and Hulu use)
> - Professional copywriting generated from your actual services and brand voice
> - Booking/inquiry integration ready
> - Full ownership — you own the code, no monthly hostage fees
> - 2 rounds of revisions included
>
> **Price: $997** (one-time, you own it forever)
>
> **Guarantee: If you don't love it, you don't pay. Period.**

### Why This Offer Works

| Element                        | How It Helps                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "48 hours"                     | Eliminates the Time Delay variable. Nobody else can promise this at this quality level. |
| "or it's free"                 | Risk reversal. Eliminates Perceived Likelihood concern. They have nothing to lose.      |
| "AI-powered brand personality" | Differentiator. This isn't a template. This is built FOR them.                          |
| "$997 one-time"                | Anchored against $3,000-$25,000 alternatives. Feels like a steal.                       |
| "You own the code"             | Eliminates the "hostage" fear of Squarespace/Wix monthly fees                           |
| "2 rounds of revisions"        | Shows confidence in quality + gives them control                                        |

### The Math

- Cost to deliver: ~$3-5 in AI API calls + your time
- If you spend 2 hours per site on revisions: that's ~$500/hour of your time
- At 10 sites/month: $9,970/month revenue
- At 30 sites/month (with refinement chat making revisions self-serve): $29,910/month

**This is a real business at 10 sites per month.** We don't need scale. We need depth.

## 5. The First 10 Customers (Proof Phase)

This is the most important section. Nothing else matters until this is done.

### The Play

Do NOT launch publicly. Do NOT build a marketing funnel. Do NOT create content. Do NOT run ads.

Instead:

**Step 1: Build 3 sites for free.**

Find 3 med spas in your area (or online). Reach out with this script:

> "Hey [Name], I'm building an AI-powered website tool specifically for med spas. I'd love to build your website for free in exchange for honest feedback and permission to use it as a case study. No strings attached — you keep the site either way. Interested?"

This is warm outreach. It works because:

- Zero risk for them (free)
- You're asking for help, not selling (flattering)
- You get three real sites to show off
- You get three real testimonials
- You learn what actually matters to med spa owners (not what you THINK matters)

**Step 2: Use those 3 sites to sell 7 more at $497 (intro price).**

Now you have proof. Show the 3 real sites and say:

> "I built these three med spa websites using our AI-powered platform. Each one took less than 48 hours. I'm taking on 7 more clients at our early-adopter price of $497 (regular price will be $997). Want one?"

**Step 3: Use those 10 sites to charge full price.**

Now you have 10 real sites, 10 testimonials, a portfolio page, and actual data on what works. Raise price to $997. Start building your lead generation engine.

### Where to Find Med Spas

1. **Google Maps:** Search "med spa" in any mid-size city. Look for ones with bad websites or no website at all.
2. **Instagram:** Search #medspa, #aesthetics, #botox + your city. DM them directly.
3. **Yelp / RealSelf:** Find highly-rated spas with poor web presence.
4. **Local networking:** Join local business groups, BNI chapters, chamber of commerce.

### What to Learn From the First 10

After building 10 sites, you'll know:

- What content med spas actually care about (services list? before/after? credentials? team?)
- What design direction they gravitate toward (luxury dark? clean white? warm?)
- What they want to change in revisions (this tells you what the AI isn't getting right)
- Whether they care about owning the code or prefer hosted
- How much hand-holding they need vs self-serve
- Whether $997 is too high, too low, or just right

This information is worth more than 6 more months of feature development.

---

## 6. What to Build Next (Product Priorities Reframed)

Stop thinking "what features are cool" and start thinking "what features make me money."

### The Revenue-Driven Roadmap

**Must have BEFORE charging money (Week 1-4):**

| Priority | Feature                    | Why It Makes Money                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Multi-page generation      | No med spa will pay for a one-page site. They need Home, Services, About, Before/After, Contact minimum.                                                       |
| 2        | Real images (stock photos) | Sites with placeholder divs look fake. Nobody pays for fake.                                                                                                   |
| 3        | Refinement chat (basic)    | "Change the headline" / "make it darker" / "add a section." Clients ALWAYS want changes. If you have to manually edit code for each revision, you can't scale. |

**Must have BEFORE scaling (Month 2-3):**

| Priority | Feature                       | Why It Makes Money                                                                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4        | One-click deployment (Vercel) | Clients don't know what a ZIP file is. They want a URL. "Here's your site: yourmedspa.com"                    |
| 5        | Contact form that works       | The #1 thing a med spa website needs to do is capture inquiries. A form that doesn't submit is a dealbreaker. |
| 6        | User accounts                 | You need to save client sites so they can come back. Also needed for ongoing relationship.                    |

**Can wait (Month 4+):**

- Booking integration (Calendly embed)
- Blog/CMS
- Commerce features
- Visual editor
- Analytics

### What NOT to Build

- Do not build a visual editor right now. That's a 6-month project that delays revenue.
- Do not build e-commerce. Med spas don't sell products online (primarily).
- Do not build user authentication for public sign-up. You're manually onboarding the first 50 clients anyway.
- Do not build a knowledge base / learning system. Premature optimization.

---

## 7. Pricing Strategy

### The Pricing Ladder

```
FREE        →  $0     →  3 proof-of-concept sites (you reach out, you build)
EARLY BIRD  →  $497   →  Next 7-10 sites (limited offer, creates urgency)
STANDARD    →  $997   →  One-time purchase, you own the code, 2 revisions
PREMIUM     →  $1,997 →  Everything in Standard + custom domain setup,
                          deployment, 5 revisions, 30-day support
MONTHLY     →  $97/mo →  Hosted + managed: updates, uptime, minor changes
                          (this is the recurring revenue play)
```

### Why This Works

**$997 one-time anchors against $5,000-$15,000 agency work.** It feels like a no-brainer.

**$97/month recurring is the long game.** Once you have 100 clients on $97/month, that's $9,700/month in recurring revenue — money that comes in whether you build anything new or not. This is the subscription model Hormozi loves: low enough to not think about, high enough to build a real business.

**The monthly model also creates switching costs.** Once their site is hosted with you and their domain points to your servers, they're not going to move it. That's not manipulation — it's delivering ongoing value (uptime, updates, support) and charging for it.

### Revenue Targets

| Milestone      | Clients                   | Revenue           | Timeline   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Proof phase    | 10                        | ~$5,000           | Month 1-2  |
| Early traction | 30                        | ~$25,000 total    | Month 3-4  |
| Sustainable    | 50 one-time + 20 monthly  | $50k + $1,940/mo  | Month 5-6  |
| Real business  | 100 one-time + 50 monthly | $100k + $4,850/mo | Month 8-12 |

These aren't aggressive numbers. This is one niche, one offer, one person doing the work.

---

## 8. Lead Generation (After Proof Phase)

Hormozi's "Core Four" lead generation methods, adapted for us:

### 1. Warm Outreach (FREE — do this first and forever)

- DM med spas on Instagram with before/after of their current site vs what you could build
- Email med spa owners directly (find emails on their websites)
- Network at local business events, aesthetic industry conferences
- Ask every client for 2 referrals

**Script template:**

> "I noticed [specific thing about their current site — slow, dated design, not mobile-friendly, etc.]. I build AI-powered websites specifically for med spas. Here's an example of what I built for [Client Name]: [link]. Would you be open to a quick chat about upgrading yours?"

### 2. Content Creation (FREE — start month 2)

- Post before/after website comparisons on Instagram/TikTok
- "I rebuilt this med spa's website in 15 minutes using AI — here's what happened"
- Short-form video of the intake process → generated site reveal
- Show the AI assembly happening in real-time (this is genuinely fascinating to watch)
- Write for med spa industry publications about web presence

**The reveal moment is your content goldmine.** When the AI assembles a site and it looks professional — that's a "wow" moment. Record it. Share it. Every platform.

### 3. Cold Outreach (LOW COST — start month 2-3)

- Build a list of med spas with bad websites (Google Maps + manual review)
- Send personalized Loom videos: "I looked at your current site and here's what I'd do differently" + show a mock-up generated by the tool
- Follow up 3 times (most sales happen on follow-up 2-5)

### 4. Paid Ads (LAST — start month 4+ after validating everything above)

- Meta ads targeting med spa owners/managers
- Google ads for "med spa website design"
- Only run ads after you have proven messaging from warm/cold outreach

**Hormozi's rule: Don't spend money to learn. Spend time to learn, then spend money to scale what works.**

---

## 9. Competitive Moat

Why won't Squarespace, Wix, or some VC-funded startup just copy this?

### Our Actual Advantages

1. **Brand personality capture.** Nobody else does a 9-step brand discovery process. Squarespace gives you a template and says "customize it." We understand what you want before we build anything. This is genuinely novel.

2. **Speed.** 15-minute intake → complete site. No other tool does this at comparable quality. Wix ADI is closest but produces generic results.

3. **Niche expertise.** When we go deep on med spas (or whatever niche), we accumulate knowledge that makes each site better than the last. The 50th med spa site we build will be dramatically better than the 1st. A generic tool can't do this.

4. **Quality per dollar.** At $997, we're 3-10x cheaper than the alternatives with comparable quality. The unit economics work because AI does the heavy lifting.

5. **Evolving knowledge base.** Every site built trains the system. Proven component configurations, content patterns, and theme palettes compound over time. This is a data moat that gets stronger with every customer.

### What's NOT a Moat

- The technology itself. AI website generation is becoming commoditized. Someone will build something similar.
- The component library. Any good developer can build components.
- Being "AI-powered." That's a feature, not a moat. Everyone claims AI now.

**The real moat is niche knowledge + customer relationships + accumulated data.** This is why niching down matters — it's not just a marketing strategy, it's a defensibility strategy.

## 11. Key Metrics to Track

From day one, track these numbers. They tell you if the business is healthy.

| Metric                            | What It Tells You       | Target                         |

## 12. The Hard Truth

Here's what Hormozi would say if he was sitting across the table from you:

> "You've built impressive technology. The AI brand personality system is genuinely novel. The component architecture is solid. You've clearly invested serious engineering talent and time into this.
>
> But none of that matters until someone pays you money.
>
> You're in love with the product. I get it. But the market doesn't care about your component registry or your 87 theme tokens or your emotional override system. The market cares about one thing: **does this solve my problem better than the alternatives?**
>
> You don't know the answer to that question yet. And you won't know until you put it in front of real customers and ask for real money.
>
> Stop building features. Start building proof.
>
> The first 10 customers will teach you more than the next 10,000 lines of code."

## 13. What Makes This Winnable

Despite the hard truths above, this business has real potential. Here's why:

1. **The market is massive.** There are 33 million small businesses in the US alone. Most have terrible websites or no website at all. The demand is real and growing.

2. **The alternatives are genuinely bad for most people.** Squarespace requires design skills. Agencies are expensive and slow. Freelancers are unreliable. There's a massive gap between "free template that looks generic" and "expensive custom design." We sit right in that gap.

3. **AI quality is improving rapidly.** What Claude generates today will be dramatically better in 6 months. Our product gets better just by the underlying models improving — that's free R&D.

4. **The unit economics are exceptional.** $3-5 in AI costs to produce something worth $500-$2,000. That's a 99%+ gross margin. Very few businesses have this kind of margin structure.

5. **The product is genuinely differentiated.** The brand personality capture system is not a gimmick — it produces measurably different output based on intake responses. This is a real technical innovation, not marketing fluff.

6. **Network effects compound.** Every site we build makes the system smarter. Every niche we master makes the next niche faster. Every satisfied customer generates referrals.

The question isn't "is this a good idea?" — it is. The question is "will you do the uncomfortable work of selling it before it feels ready?"

That's where businesses are won or lost.
